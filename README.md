MDI (Multiple Document Interface) is a user interface design that allows multiple child windows to be contained within a single parent window. This enables users to work with several documents simultaneously in one application. The parent window manages the layout of child windows, which can be tiled or cascaded. Common examples of MDI applications include text editors and image editing software, where multiple files are open and accessible at once.
Key Concepts:
Parent Window: The main window (MDI container) that holds all the child windows.
Child Windows: The individual windows that display different documents or data. Each child window can be activated or deactivated, but they all remain inside the parent window.
Window Management: The child windows can be managed using features like cascading (overlapping windows) or tiling (arranged side by side).
User Interaction: Users can open, close, and switch between multiple child windows without leaving the parent window, enhancing multitasking capabilities.
Document Handling: MDI is typically used in applications that involve working with multiple documents (e.g., text editors, image editors, web browsers).
